            We are looking for some hackers to come up with some potential attack vectors against security.txt files so that
            we can have a clear overview of what defense mechanisms need to be in place to protect security.txt files
            (<a href="https://github.com/securitytxt/security-txt/issues/112">https://github.com/securitytxt/security-txt/issues/112</a>).
